# The Olympics Data Analyzation

Firstly, I choose to analyze the data in Canada's Olmpics history. I researched "How many gold medals have Canada won so far", "Which medals are won the most", Compared to other countries, is Canada above the average or not. Secondly, I created 3 graphs and 3 image boxes and 5 content boxes to prove and show the result based on the data which is approved online.
